\f0\fs24 \cf0 Project 1 \
\
This project was exploring digital archaeology. We were to select a platform and research the historical and social context, and what influences these platforms have on society today. I decided to focus on Facebook, and researched about the poke UI element that had controversial issues in the value, the connotations it had throughout its history, and what it symbolizes today. I became further in treated in the gender connotations of the element that can be used as a critique not the general gender discrimination in the tech industry today. For the final week, I created a website depicting the critique on the tech industry by linking the poke element and the various famous tech people representing the tech industry. I received helpful feedback on the layout of the website as well as the need for a more serious tone in critiquing this issue. }

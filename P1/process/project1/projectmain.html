		<h2>Gender and Technology</h2>
		<article id="article01">
			<p>Most college-bound males, regardless of race/ethnicity, have a positive opinion of computing and computer science as a career or a possible major.
			College-bound females are signiﬁcantly less interested than boys are in computing; girls associate computing with typing, math, and boredom. College-bound African American and Hispanic teens, regardless of gender, are more likely than their white peers to be interested in computing, although for girls the overall interest is extremely low. Teens interested in studying computer science associate computing with words like “video games,” “design,” “electronics,” “solving problems,” and “interesting.” The strongest positive driver towards computer science or an openness to a career in computing is “having the power to create and discover new things.”</p>

		<h2>Gender Robots</h2>
		<article id="article02">
			<p>
				Stereotypes — be it gender or race — simplify complex human beings into limited key defining traits, effectively determining and streamlining how we interact with one other. They are in fact such a persistent feature in society that it is not unsurprising to find these stereotypes — gender, in particular — still perpetuated in the artificial intelligence bots that have been produced over the years. These gender stereotypes are played out in the roles that these bots are assigned to perform in an industry and their overall personalities. Female bots typically perform more administrative and secretarial roles such as assisting in the completion of routine tasks, scheduling meetings and customer service. Male bots on the other hand, often perform more analytical roles like providing financial advice and paralegal services.

		<h2 id="h201">Gender Gap is Data Gap</h2>
		<article id="article03">
			<p>The hard reality is that in too many areas, data doesn’t exist. What’s more — <strong>even where it does exist, it’s often sexist.</strong> It misses women and girls entirely, or undercounts and undervalues their economic and social contributions to their families, communities, and countries.</p>
			<ul id="ul05" class="ul">
				<li id="li17">They hamper our ability to advance the cause of gender equality.</li>
				<li id="li18">These gaps and biases reinforce the harmful stereotypes and practices that are grounded in the attitude that women and girls simply don’t matter</li>
				<li id="li19">With a better understanding of the way women live their lives, and the specific inequalities, indignities, and injustices that hold them back every day, we can see what needs fixing, whether solutions are working, and what progress is being made. That’s because gathering and analyzing data makes the invisible, visible. <strong>Closing the gender gap, requires closing the data gap.</strong></li>

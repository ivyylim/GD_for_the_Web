				<strong>Managers at Uber</strong><br>
				"In my first official day rotating on the team, my new manager sent me a string of messages over company chat. He was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn't. He was trying to stay out of trouble at work, he said, but he couldn't help getting in trouble, because he was looking for women to have sex with. When I told the Upper management, they told me that he "was a high performer" (i.e. had stellar performance reviews from his superiors) and they wouldn't feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part." - Susan Fowler<br>

				<strong>Peter Thiel</strong><br>
				In an essay published in 2009, he surprised many when he wrote that giving women the right to vote — by constitutional amendment in 1920 — was a blow to democracy. <br>

				"Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron."<br>

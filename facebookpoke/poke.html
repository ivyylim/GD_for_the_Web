	<h1>Facebook Poke Feature</h1>
	<h3>Who made the Poke Feature and Why?</h3>

	<p>
		Mark Zukerberg added the facebook poke feature on “The facebook”in 2004. When a little website called TheFacebook.com launched in 2004, there were very few bells and whistles. But there was one very beloved feature — a button to "Poke" other users. The poke didn't come with any explanation or rules. Zuckerberg, then 23, said he just wanted to make something with no real purpose. For years, Facebook as a company did not explain what poking implied (see this vague interpretation from its FAQ page in 2007), and so it was up to the first generation of the network's users to define the poke. "When we created the poke, we thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose," explains Facebook. "People interpret the poke in many different ways, and we encourage you to come up with your own meanings." But Facebookers soon tire of poking. Many invite their friends to inflict a number of different verbs on them. The result is an anarchic Bacchanalian circus in which friends alternately fondle and throw sheep at each other.

	<h3>What is it used for?</h3>
	<p>
		Facebook Help Community -- People poke their friends or friends of friends on Facebook for a lot of reasons (ex: just saying hello, getting their attention). When you poke someone, they'll receive a notification.
		A sign that you approved their online activity- but perhaps its purpose has been replaced by facebook likes, loves, and hearts

	<p>
		Aaron Sittig drew the current poke icon (along with many others) as part of the original News Feed launch in September 2006. The poke hand was originally flesh-colored, but we all agreed it looked a little bit like another body part, so we opted to go with a blue hand instead.

Or something dangerous 2006 op-ed article from Brown University, which affiliated the poke with such a high level of sexual tension that it led two seniors to have an "awkward" one-night stand. Then there was this Mashable post, which said a poke between two people in 2007 led to their marriage in 2014. <br>

		<h5>2008 </h5>
		virtual pickup line , "most of the work to succeeding on Facebook is before you poke her. She will receive the poke, look at your pictures, and then if she likes them she will poke back. After that simply add her as a friend and get ready to message her." How sweet.<br>

		<h5>2009</h5>

			<ul>
				 <li>Poke a friend with a message, photo or video </li>
				 <li>Choose how long they can see it </li>
				 <li>Press and hold to see pokes from friends</li>
				 <li>Say where you are when you poke</li>
				 <li>See when your friends take screenshots</li>
			</ul>

		<h5>2015</h5>
		people are confused but they still poke back ( form of an etiquette?) If the truly accepted definition was the poke was now "creepy," I was surprised to see everyone I poked (including an old teacher) all poked me back — though to be fair, they were a bit confused. Even in 2015 if a friend pokes you, it's only polite to poke them back to say "hi."
